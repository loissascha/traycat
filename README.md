# Traycat

**A cute running cat animation on your taskbar**

Increases speed based on your CPU usage.

# Usage

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/loissascha/traycat/releases) page and download the latest zip file (named: traycat-vx.x-linux-amd64.zip)

2. Make sure the binary is executable (run `chmod +x traycat` if you are not sure)

3. Run with `./traycat` (you can change the color of the cat like this: `./traycat -theme=light`)

## Installation

If you want to install it traycat in you ~/.local/bin run the install.sh script `chmod +x install.sh & ./install.sh`

## Autostart

If you want traycat to automatically start on login, run the autostart.sh script `chmod +x autostart.sh & ./autostart.sh` (*This will also run the install.sh script as the autostart entry expects the traycat binary to be available in your ~/.local/bin directory*)

This project was heavily inspired (and uses some of it's sprites) by [RunCat365](https://github.com/Kyome22/RunCat365)
